<a name="parking-meter-service-request-application" class="anchor" href="#parking-meter-service-request-application"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Parking Meter Service Request Application.</h3>

<p>The Parking Meter Service Request application will allow a resident or visitor to report a problem with a parking meter by phone without using a Government Operator. The Parking Meter application will interact with a Parking Meter Service Request API to create a service request that can be submitted to the Motorola CSR software through the Open311 API.  </p>

<p>The Service Request application presents a recorded message to users asking first for the meter identification number, and second for a numeric code representing the problem they encountered.  The Service Request application then provides this numeric string to a custom Parking Meter Service Request API.</p>

<p>The Parking Meter Service Request API will accept the numeric string and convert the numbers that represent the location into a true meter id.  The Parking Meter Service Request API will then refer to a database that provides locations for every parking meter in the city and determine the actual street address for the meter. The Parking Meter Service Request API will decode the number that represents the trouble reported. With the meter location and reported issue, the Parking Meter Service Request API will then submit an Open311 compliant string to the CSR Open311 API and wait for a service confirmation number (SR) that will represent a successful submission. This SR number will then be returned to the Service Request Application and reported to the user before the call ends.
â€ƒ
Finally, a server-side php script is used to interface with an SMS service provider to provide callers with the option of receiving  a text confirmation of the Service Request.</p>
